         <p>How to TEI Enricher 101:
            The .xml file you'll be working on is always saved in "name of folder you assigned" --> 102_derived_tei.
            It's important to download and extract the .zip-file in a file directory where you can write --> 
            <hi rend="bold">not</hi> directly on the Desktop, but rather create a new folder in :c, unzip the Enricher file there and save the files you will be working on all in same place. 
            Another important piece of information: TEI Enricher does not run on Mac or Linux, only Windows.
            If you're having issues with seeing the part of the Enricher responsible for navigating the dicitionary data and for editing any meta-data and visualising the entries,
            try playing around with the panel width and see which values work (better) - there're unfortunately no one size fits all values
            since every pc's resolution is different so you just have to try what works for you.
            CTRL + F3 transforms your .xml file and let's you see it in the browser, ALT + F3 does indents and structures your .xml file. 
            F7 opens a new window suggesting elements which can be nestled into your tree.</p>
